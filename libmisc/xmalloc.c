/* Replacements for malloc and strdup with error checking.  Too trivial
   to be worth copyrighting :-).  I did that because a lot of code used
   malloc and strdup without checking for NULL pointer, and I like some
   message better than a core dump...  --marekm
   
   Yeh, but.  Remember that bailing out might leave the system in some
   bizarre state.  You really want to put in error checking, then add
   some back-out failure recovery code. -- jfh */
